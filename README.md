# LinguLinks:
<h2>LinguLink offers language learning in a meaningful way that promotes social impact. The app would teach users a variety of languages, including grammar, syntax, basic words, and other relevant skills. Once users complete the lessons and pass a series of language tests e.g. Spanish, they would then be paired with a child from an underrepresented area where e.g. Spanish is their primary language, and you would teach the child English through the skills you’ve learned in Spanish.

<li> Adaptive Learning: Use machine learning and artificial intelligence to personalize the learning experience for each user, adapting to their learning style and progress. </li>
<li>Impact Tracking: Allow users to track their impact on the child they are paired with, such as how many hours they have spent teaching, the progress of the child's language learning, and other metrics.</li>
<li>Language proficiency: To ensure that users have reached a sufficient level of proficiency, the app could implement language proficiency assessments or tests throughout the learning process to determine whether users are ready to move on to the next stage of the program. The app could also provide additional language learning resources or offer personalized tutoring for users who need extra help. </li>
